# System-Integration-and-Architecture
I want to have a better understanding of the design, structure, and maintenance of the system, which is the major goal of this course on System Integration and Architecture. I want to learn how many different components of a system interact with one another and how to maintain the system's overall functionality and stability.

Also, i have to find out how to keep these systems' structures in good condition. It is not only about building it, but also about ensuring they are scalable, reliable, and efficient for users over time. I believe this course will help me recognize potential issues within a system and implement functional solutions to maintain its smooth operation.

Lastly, I expect this subject to provide me with both theoretical knowledge and practical approaches that can be applied in real-world scenarios. By the end of this course, I hope to strengthen my skills in analyzing, designing, and integrating systems in a way that supports long-term sustainability and adaptability to ensure the quality and efficiency of the system.
